# ENV required settings
Create .env file on the root of the project and add this settings

PORT = 3001
URL = https://www.reddit.com/search.json
WHITE_LIST_CORS = http://localhost:3000

I used the ports 3000 for react and 3001 for server side

The project has folders for the controllers and routes.
The logic for performing the required task is located on the files inside.

To start the node Server in the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
